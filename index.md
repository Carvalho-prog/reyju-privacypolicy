**Last updated:** 05/08/2025

This Privacy Policy describes how the bot **Reiju**, developed by **Carvalho**, collects, stores, and uses data within the Discord servers where it is used.

By adding or interacting with the Reiju bot, you agree to the terms of this Policy.

## 1. Information Collected

Reiju **does not collect sensitive personal data**. The bot only uses basic data provided by the Discord API for its features to function properly. This data includes:

- Server ID (Guild ID)  
- User ID  
- Role ID  
- User nickname (server-specific nickname)  
- Associations between roles and abbreviations configured by server administrators

No message content, uploaded files, or users' private information is stored.

## 2. How the Data Is Used

The collected data is used **exclusively for the following purposes**:

- To check whether a user has used the nickname update panel  
- To apply role-based prefixes to nicknames  
- To update or remove prefixes automatically when roles are added or removed  
- To allow administrators to view, edit, or reset information related to these features

## 3. Data Storage

- The data is **stored locally** in the environment where the bot is hosted (e.g., a computer or cloud service).  
- No data is transmitted to third parties, stored in external databases, or shared with anyone besides the developer (**Carvalho**).  
- Access to the data is restricted and protected using basic operating system security practices.

## 4. Data Sharing

Reiju **does not share data with third parties**.

Stored data is accessed only by the developer **Carvalho**, solely for maintenance, bug fixes, or bot improvements.

---

## 5. User Rights

Any user on a server where Reiju is present may request the removal of their record through a server administrator. This can be done via the `/resetarnick` command, which allows the administrator to remove that user's data.

---

## 6. Data Retention

Data remains stored as long as the bot is active on the server. If the bot is removed or reset, the data may be permanently deleted.

---

## 7. Changes to This Policy

This policy may be updated at any time to reflect changes in functionality or data usage. Significant changes will be communicated via the GitHub repository or other methods defined by the developer.
